# Emotion-Detection-OpenCV-Pytorch-ResNet9

In this Project, A ResNet9 architecture based model was trained on a Dataset containing 28000+ images spreaded across 7 different classes of emotions.
And then the Model was used in a Real Time Application made using Tkinter.

Dataset link - [kaggle/datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/de270025c781ba47a3a6d774a0d670452bfb4dc9d2d6b13740cdb0c17aa7bf2b)

I have used the Model architecture and code from Conero007's [repository](https://github.com/Conero007/Emotion-Detection-Pytorch) which was trained on 5 Classes.

* So I trained it on 7 Classes - Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad and Surprise with 28709 images
* Added System Structure
* Added Complete Workflow
* Added ResNet9 Architecture
* Added Confusion Matrix
* Added Classification Report

P.S : *Completed this project half a year ago, had it in my local machine the entire time but just got time to make it online, there are more projects, I'm going to be hostiong online soon*

summarize the results of the competitions. We provide suggestions for or-
