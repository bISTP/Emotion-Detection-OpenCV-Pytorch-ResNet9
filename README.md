# Emotion-Detection-OpenCV-Pytorch-ResNet9

In this Project, A ResNet9 architecture based model was trained on a Dataset containing 28000+ images spreaded across 7 different classes of emotions.
And then the Model was used in a Real Time Application made using Tkinter.

Dataset link - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/de270025c781ba47a3a6d774a0d670452bfb4dc9d2d6b13740cdb0c17aa7bf2b

I have used the Model architecture and code from https://github.com/Conero007/Emotion-Detection-Pytorch Repository which was trained on 5 Classes.
So I trained it on 7 Classes, Added Confusion Matrix, Classification Report Etc.
